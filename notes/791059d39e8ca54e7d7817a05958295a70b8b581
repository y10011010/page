on container exit secure erase ... level depending on the time of day
turns out secure erase doesn't work on partitions, or requires the whole disk to
be reformatted. This means the system could be rearchitected so that workspace
and backups are not on the same drive.

a workaround is to use      dd if=/dev/urandom of=random_file bs=1000000000
count=1  to generate random data and overwrite workspace. Both options require
some effort which there is no time for right now. It's a choice between security
and expediency


Actually, there is eraseVolume which erases a volume. it can then be reformatted
